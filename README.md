# all-of-statistics

This repository contains my own personal notes and complete solutions from my self-study for Larry Wasserman's "All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference".  The notes and exercises are based on an older edition of the book -- note the chapter sequence and titles -- though there is almost complete overlap with the latest edition.

Main definitions, ideas, and theorems from each chapter are included in the notes, but examples are usually skipped.  This repository is not intended as a replacement for the book.

Each included chapter has a Jupyter notebook including notes on the chapter and exercise solutions -- notes and solutions using LaTeX in markdown and executable Python.
