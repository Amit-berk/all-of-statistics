# all-of-statistics

This repository contains my own personal notes (and exercise solutions) on self-study for Larry Wasserman's "All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference".  The notes and exercises are based on an older edition of the book -- note the chapter sequence and titles -- though there is almost complete overlap with the latest edition.

Main definitions, ideas, and theorems from each chapter are included in the notes, but most examples are skipped.  This repository is not intended as a replacement for the book, but as notes from personal study.

Each included chapter has a Jupyter notebook including notes on the chapter and exercise solutions -- intermingling LaTeX notation in markdown and executable code.
